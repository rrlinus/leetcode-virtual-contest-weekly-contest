1482. Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets
Problem:problem say that you are given an array of integers in which the ith element represents that the ith flowers  will bloom in arr[ith] day. you have also given integers m and k. you have to make m boquetes .where every boquete requires excatly k contigious flowers.
you have to make m boquetes in such a way that the maximum bloom day is minimized.


class Solution {
public:
    int minDays(vector<int>& bloomDay, int m, int k) {
        int start=1,end=*max_element(bloomDay.begin(),bloomDay.end())+1;
        int n=bloomDay.size();
        if(m*k>n)
            return -1;
        while(start<end){
            int mid=start+(end-start)/2;
            int ct=0,bo=0;
            for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
                if(bloomDay[i]>mid){
                    ct=0;
                }
                else if(++ct>=k){
                    bo++;
                    ct=0;
                }
            }
            if(bo<m){
                start=mid+1;
            }
            else
            {
                end=mid;
