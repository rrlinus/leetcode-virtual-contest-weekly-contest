problem Name:1481. Least Number of Unique Integers after K Removals

The problem says that you are given an array of integer of size n.Task is to remove k elements from the given array such that total number of unique elements left in the array should be minimum.


Approach:
idea here is remove that elements which has minimum frequency.it means that first we have to count the occurences of each elements of the given array and then sort them according to their frequency in decresing order as we have to remove the lements so if we remove elements from the last then it would take O(nlogn).

class Solution {
public:
    int findLeastNumOfUniqueInts(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        unordered_map<int,int> mp;
        int n=arr.size();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            mp[arr[i]]++;
        }
        vector<int> freq;
        for(auto it:mp){
            freq.push_back(it.second);
        }
        sort(freq.begin(),freq.end(),greater<int>());
        while(freq.size()>0 and k>0){
            k-=freq[freq.size()-1];
            if(k>=0){
                freq.pop_back();
            }
        }
        return freq.size();
    }
};
