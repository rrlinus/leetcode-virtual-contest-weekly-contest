problem 1:Range sum 1D

What problem statement says:You are given an array of integers of size n.you have to return the sum from 0th index to ith index for 0<=i<n.

Bruteforce Approach:
for each element of the array we will traverse from 0 to ith index and put their sum into a new array.finally return our new array.

Algo:
new_array=[]
for i=0 to i<n;i++
   sum=0;
   for j=0;j<=i;j++
      sum +=arr[j]
   new_array[i]=sum
 return new_array
      

Time Complexity:O(n^2)

How can we optimize it?
use this formula.
sn=tn+s(n-1)

new_array[0]=a[0];
for i=1;i<n;i++
    new_array[i]=new_array[i-1]+arr[i]
return new_array;

Time complexity:O(n)
